# Space-Invaders
  This project is a competitive reimagination of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The gameplay consists of two players attempting to shoot each other down, but there are alien ships in the way that must be overcome first. However, these enemy ships aren’t just obstacles. Destroying them strengthens the player’s ship, adding a strategic element to the gameplay.

  
On the technical side, this project features modular object-oriented classes, sound integration using the Processing sound library, real-time input handling, and state management.
## Game Features
1) 24 enemy aliens with randomized shot patterns. Beware of the aliens in the middle row! They are more deadly.
2) Power-ups from killing enemies. Watch your firerate, movement speed, and bullet velocity ramp up as you take down aliens.
3) Six barricades to help defend against the initial onslaught of bullets. 
## How to run

## Developer's Note
While originally created in January 2023, this project was updated in May 2025 to showcase my current skill level. While the core functionality and scope of the original project were preserved, the code structure has been optimized for readability and reusability.
